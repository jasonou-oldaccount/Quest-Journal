# Quest-Journal
Quest Journal is an addictive productivity application that helps users get the work done while having fun. We help transform your normal day tasks into adventure quests, as if you were in an adventure game. You can create your own quests and choose the difficulty on it as well. When a quest is complete, your sprite/character will gain experience points! The harder the quest, the more experience you get! As your character gains experience and levels up, they will evolve!  Challenge your friends and see who can complete the most quest or see who has the higher level character!
